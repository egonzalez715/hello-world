Hello World project/my first repository

My name is Jesus Efrain Gonzalez Jr, but I go by just Efrain. 
I have taken an introductory college course on c++ programming, and I am currently self-teaching myself some more coding for fun, mostly in c++ and Python. 
I know some basic matlab and java as well. I hope to learn a lot more!
